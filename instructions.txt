To use, copy this into terminal line

python label_image.py \
--graph=128img/output_graph.pb --labels=128img/output_labels.txt \
--input_layer=Placeholder \
--output_layer=final_result \
--image=(whatever your image location for testing is)



Sorry the file is so big, but that's just how the graph is
